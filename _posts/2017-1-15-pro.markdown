* **Build a CNN based deep learning model to learn and break captchas**.

* The [project](https://github.com/tharidu/breakingcaptcha) was done as part of deep learning course at KTH with Tharidu and Dominik.

* Trained the model on a dataset of 200,000 captchas on Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU an AWS EC2 instance.

* Tensorflow was used as the deep learning library.

* The model achieved an accuracy of ~98%.
