* **Counting Global and Local Triangles in Streaming Graphs**.

* The [project](https://github.com/akash13singh/Triest/) was done as part of Data Mining course at KTH. 


* Implementation of [paper](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/subtopic/view/triest-counting-local-and-global-triangles-in-fully-dynamic-streams-with-fi).

* Triangle count is commonly used in network analysis, random graph models, and real world applications like link-recommendation, spam detection etc.
